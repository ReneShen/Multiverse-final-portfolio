<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

During my time at Box, I delivered value through improvements and added functionality in existing E-commerce codebases while leading projects that drives company revenue, such as cancellation flow. This document is a broad overview of my contributions to the company's services without revealing any sensitive information. 

Because of the security reasons, I will avoid using any code snippets and rely just on explanation.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Multiverse for their continued support throughout my apprenticeship process. They have truly paved the way into a new career for me by providing 24/7 accessible resources, constructive lessons, hands on project building exercises, and supportive coaches. Not to mention the support I got from the apprentices in my cohort. They're a big part of the reason why I can keep on pushing myself in this journey.

Of course, I'd also' like to thank Box for employing me and giving me such a great learning environment to hone my skills. 
Being a Multiverse apprentice at Box has been the most valuable and incredible experience I've ever had. There are not many people who have the opportunity to not only jump into a totally different career path or have the opportunity to learn so much on the job. 
Being a boxer has helped me improve in so many different ways with the help of all the Boxers I’ve encountered especially my teammates. The fact that we’re constantly reminding ourselves to be an owner and to make mom proud has kept me working at being my best self every single day.

A special thanks to E-commerce team at Box. The people on the team has showed me a different way of working. They've showed me that learning is a life long process, and being kind and reasonable to others and oneself is crucial while working hard and giving our best at doing what we love. It's been such an amazing journey to learn from all these incredible and knowledgeable engineers, PMs, and designers.

I’m extremely grateful for Box and Multiverse to give me this opportunity. As a result I'm able to jump from a professional baker to a full-time software engineer in such a short time period.
