<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
I believe one of the biggest reasons why Box was rated second best place to work for on Glassdoor 2022 is because Box understands, values, and provides courses for employees to improve their durable skills.

## Durable Skills
<!-- Problem Solving -->
### Problem Solving
<ul>
  <li>Identify the problem</li> 
  <li>Reproduce the problem</li> 
  <li>Solve the problem</li> 
</ul>
<br/>
<p>I learned how to identify the core problem using ticket descriptions and reproducing the bugs. I also learned how to solve problems using company and internet documentation, team and Stackoverflow conversations, and debugging skills from solving team JIRA tickets.</p>

<!-- Communication -->
### Communication
<ul>
  <li>Ask questions with key points</li> 
  <li>Run meetings with a set agenda</li>
  <li>Provide feedback constantly</li>
  <li>Practice ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)</li>
  <li>Practice tunnel analysis</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Since day one working at the E-commerce team at Box, my manager has expressed the importance of providing feedback. I found out soon enough that constanly giving the team my point of view on certain things not only helps them understand how to provide me more specific resources to learn better, it also helps the future teammates that join the team to adapt to the team culture and codebase faster. Additionally, my manager and supervisor at my team at Box have helped me understand the importance of ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5). There's no other person that will understand more about the project I investigated. Being able to practice ELI5 reduces a lot of confusion, and is able to help others to understand how to provide me resources and direction in a shorter time period. One of the biggest ways to learn how to operate in a remote environment in my team at Box is by leveraging the Watercooler meeting time. Essentially, this is a meeting where developers discuss the issues or observations with the team and come up with some further action items or solutions. These meetings often take up many engineers' attention, and to make this meeting time as efficient as possible. Practicing presention skills, such as tunnel analysis becomes crucial.</p> 

<!-- Involved in Teams and Communities -->
### Involvement in Teams and Communities
<ul>
  <li>Organize and hold events</li>
  <li>Participate in community events</li>
  <li>Provide feedback and let teammates know my appreciation</li>
  <li>Share common interests with others</li>
  <li>Contribute my value back to the community</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Joining the team during the pandemic made me realize that it's even more essential to think about how to build a better relationship with each team member. For example, I set a weekly reminder on Google canlendar to make sure I talk to most of the team member at least once per week. Additionally, I organized and held a cupcake baking event and a Secret Santa event with the team through zoom calls. I also think it's important to share common interests with teammates during lunch or after working hours, ex. I sometimes share self-baked desserts with teammates at lunch and share some recipes with the teammates that also love baking at home. Participating in different community events is also helpful in this espect. For example, I participated in Box Learn Fest to learn some must have skills as a Boxer (Make mom proud, Overcoming Bias, etc.), Box API (Asian Pacific Islander) community events, and Box Lunch events.
<br/>
It is equally important to contribute my value back to the community often. At Multiverse, I have participated in some Multiverse "Meet the Apprentice" meetings to share some of my experiences as an apprentice while working at Box. At Box, I've presented some interesting skills learned from Multiverse to the team members at Box and presented a Multiverse project to an Engineer All Hands meeting at Box while sharing some thoughts and experiences of being an apprentice.
</p>

<!-- Initiative Taking -->
### Initiative Taking
<ul>
  <li>Solve tickets independantly</li>
  <li>Ask for resources and directions instead of a direct answer</li>
  <li>Update documents and clean up code while working</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>While solving more and more, and bigger and bigger tickets at work, I was able to develop the habit of discovering more code that needs improvement while solving another ticket, creating a ticket for the code that needs improvment, completing and cleaning the codebase better, then documenting all the observations, solving processes, and solutions on my own. Being an engineer, often times we read through a lot of documentation and try to find the solutions on our own. This means deprecated documentation might contribute to unnecessary engineer time and might even influence a company's profit in the long run. With that being said, I often update the deprecated documentation I encounter at Box.</p>

<!-- Learning from Others 24/7 -->
### Learning from Others 24/7
<ul>
  <li>Review others' PRs (Pull Requests)</li>
  <li>Attend Watercooler meetings</li>
  <li>Ask for pair programming opportunities</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>I participated in the company Hackathon event and learned how a Project Manager leads a team with data scientists, designers, and software engineers to brainstorm and execute the most suitable project for the team, and how an experienced engineer creates an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in a short time period. Learning how other engineers write their code by reviewing their PRs (Pull Requests) and attending watercooler meetings when an engineer presents an issue or thought that needs a whole team's attention. The other great way to learn how other engineers organize their projects and solve problems is through pair programming.</p>
</ul>
