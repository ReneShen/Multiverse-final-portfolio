## Overview
While creating different projects at Multiverse bootcamps, there are so many valuable technical skills I learned while solving JIRA tickets at Box. These skills are important, since a lot of them are not able to be learned from courses. These real life practices definitely are a big endeavor to become a better software engineer. The overall skills I learned on the job are:
<ul>
  <li>Webapp security</li>
  <li>Webapp created using PHP and React</li>
  <li>Leading projects using BDD(Behavior Driven Development) and Gherkin syntax</li>
  <li>Writing code using TDD(Test Driven Development)</li>
  <li>Debug issues</li>
  <li>Transactions process</li>
  <li>3rd party tools Box uses, ex. Marketing, data science, monitoring, etc.</li>
</ul>
